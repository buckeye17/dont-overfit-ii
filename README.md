# dont-overfit-ii
Kaggle competition files for Don't Overfit! II

The environment.yml file provides the kernel definition used to produce my results.

The dont-overfit.ipynb Jupyter notebook provides all of the analysis for this project.  To re-run this analysis you will need to modify the `data_path` variable in the first code cell to match the directory where you have saved this repository.

Note, the test.csv file was too large for Github, so it has been zipped.  In order to run my notebook you will need to unzip this file.

The project has been summarized on my Githib page here: [https://buckeye17.github.io/Dont-Overfit/](https://buckeye17.github.io/Dont-Overfit/)
